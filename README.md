# Know-ASCII

**Know-ASCII** is a responsive and functional web-application built using HTML,CSS and Javascript.

---
## What it does 
It's Simple !

It gives the ASCII value for Alphanumerics.

---
## How it works 

It uses my own fake JSON API, called [ASCII-API](https://github.com/code-reaper08/ASCII-API), to fetch data and display it to the user when he gives input.

To know more about my
 [ASCII-API](https://github.com/code-reaper08/ASCII-API),
